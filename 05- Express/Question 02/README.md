# Middleware for Checking User Authentication

- **This middleware checks if the user is authenticated or not and then sends the data of the post.**

## How it works

The middleware works by checking if the user is authenticated. If the user is authenticated, the middleware calls the next() function, which allows the route to continue executing. If the user is not authenticated, the middleware sends a 401 Unauthorized response.
